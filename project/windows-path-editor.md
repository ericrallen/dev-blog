blurb: Simple interface for editing your $PATH on Windows.
featured: true

Before the Linux Subsystem for Window was available, editing your `$PATH` required
so many clicks and popups and then you had to edit it in a tiny little text box.

I was working on an Electron-based game on Windows and needed to do some basic path
manipulation to get my usual tools up and running. After the second time I needed to
access the `$PATH` text box, I decided that there must be a better way.

It turned out there wasn't, so I built one.
