We have a lot of developers working in different places at different times at [Skookum](https://skookum.com/). People are sharing interesting, useful, and/or important articles at various times throughout the day. Unfortunately a lot of that content is missed by the majority of developers.

Enter [@RSS bot](https://www.rssbot.app/), a Slack bot that will generate an RSS feed of links shared in channels it is invited into.

Every time a user shares a link in a channel it is listening to @RSS bot will ask that user if they would like to add the link to the channel's RSS feed, so users have control over what appears in their RSS feed.

Are you tired of missing links shared in your Slack channels?
