Sometimes, you want to build something for fun, but it turns out to be pretty useful. I've always wanted to build something like the [Matrix Effect](https://beforesandafters.com/2019/03/27/secrets-of-the-matrix-code/). There are plenty of examples out there already, but it felt like something a cyberpunk-obsessed '90s kid _should_ build.

<Ciph3rTextDemo />

An early prototype of how I wanted to approach the effect ended up a little different, but it turns out to be useful for all sorts of applications I never would have considered.

From interactive game interfaces to web applications, being able to easily apply transformations and animations to arbitrary strings is pretty great.

I wrapped the code up into a [text transformation Component for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@interwebalchemy/ciph3r-text) and [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/InterwebAlchemy/ciph3r-text).

It's as easy to use as:

```bash
npm add @interwebalchemy/ciph3r-text
```

**Note**: You can use `bun`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, etc., too. [JavaScript Registry (`jsr`)](https://jsr.io/) support is coming soon.

```tsx
import Ciph3rText from "@interwebalchemy/ciph3r-text";

export default function Component() {
  return <Ciph3rText defaultText="Hello, world!" action="decode" />;
}
```

**Note**: This is currently React-only because that's what I was working on at the time, but if there's interest, I can port it to other frameworks or release a framework-agnostic build via [Mitosis](https://mitosis.builder.io/) or vanilla JavaScript.

By default, `Ciph3rText` uses a pretty standard set of alphanumeric characters and basic symbols, but [unicode can get pretty wild](<[https://fontgenerator.cool/](https://kermitproject.org/utf8.html)>). Like, [positively Lovecraftian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalgo_text).

For the [tech demo I created for the Winter 2025 Recurse Center Game Jam](https://github.com/DVDAGames/lost-signal/) - that was the first video above - I had a lot of fun gathering unique characters to use with `Ciph3rText`.

Here are some examples of just a few of the unique Unicode characters you can use:

- **Anglo-Saxon Runes**: `ᚳ᛫ᛗᚨᚷᛚᛋᛖᚩᛏᚪᚾᛞᚻᛁᚱᚧ᛬ᚠᛇᛒᛦᚦᚢᚹᚳᚫ`
- **Old Irish Runes**: `᚛ᚉᚑᚅᚔᚋᚈᚍᚂᚐᚌᚓ᚜`
- **Math Symbols**: `⏀⏁⏂⏃⏄⏅⏆⏇⏈⏉⏊⏋⏌⏍`
- **Miscellaneous Symbols**: `çﾘｸƵツᐊ╌¿£⭔`
- **Blocks**: `▒ ░ █ ▚ ▞ ▜ ▝`

The `<Ciph3rText />` component also has a number of configurable properties to control the effect's behavior:

<Ciph3rTextPlayground defaultText="Enter the Matrix" action="decode" />

- `defaultText` (**required**): the text to display during server rendering, after decoding, or before encoding or transforming
- `action`: controls whether the text transformation uses `encode`, `decode`, `transform`, or `scramble` logic; defaults to `encode`
- `targetText`\*: the text to transform into when using `action="transform"`
- `onFinish`\*\*: callback to execute when the `defaultText` has been fully `decode`d, `encode`d, or `transform`ed
- `iterationSpeed`: how frequently the logic to change characters executes; `120` for `encode`/`decode`/`scramble` and `150` for `transform`
- `maxIterations`\*\*: how many times the logic to change characters can run; `36` for `encode`/`decode` and `54` for `transform`
- `characters`: a limited string of characters that you want to use in the effect; defaults to [alphanumeric English characters and basic symbols]([view source](https://github.com/InterwebAlchemy/ciph3r-text/blob/main/src/Ciph3rText/constants.ts#L2))
- `additionalCharacters`: an optional string of characters that you want to use in addition to the `characters`; this provides an easy way to have a base character set and add specific characters for different effects

\* _required if `action="transform"`_<br />
\*\* _not applicable if `action="scramble"`_

**Usage Tips**:

- For more interesting effects, like the ones in the Lost Signal demo, you may want to break your string into chunks of random sizes and apply varying text colors, `iterationSpeed`s, etc., to each chunk.
- Find some unique characters to use. Maybe get inspired by [the Matrix](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/182823/217400) or add some [cursed diacritics](https://lingojam.com/CursedText)?
- You can leverage the `onFinish` callback to swap `defaultText` and `targetText` or change the `action` to create effects chains.
- You can use the `characters` and `addtionalCharacters` properties to dynamically change the characters used in the effect.
